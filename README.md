# Veishea
A 2-day XNA project where you play as one of the 2014 VEISHEA rioters at ISU! For context, here is a video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFy1JL1pQwQ

Begin an epic quest of idiocy, where you can guzzle beer until you puke, knock over street lights and flip cars!

Each action gathers more rioters to help you commit more stupidity, and ultimately fill your stupid-o-meter to the top, making hundreds
lose faith in humanity!



(note: we would have been showing off our real game at the time if the rioters had not gotten all VEISHEA activities cancelled, so I may
have been slightly salty while creating this masterpiece. Nevertheless, it is my magnum opus.)
